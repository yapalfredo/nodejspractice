# nodejspractice - ToDoApp

## What's the purpose of this project?
Still part of my "getting back to coding in 2021" journey.  
Trying to get used to JavaScript (NodeJS).  
For the next week or two, I will just eat and sleep NodeJS.  
After that, I will start learning Solidity so I can build smart contracts.  
This is a stepping stone to achieving my goal.  
I have an "unique idea", for a Decentralized Finance app in mind, and I haven't seen anyone implemented it yet.  
I can't tell about it here yet because I want to be the first one to do it.  
I'm basically on the research/acquiring skill phase right now. Once I'm done with this, I will go full throttle in building my app.  
Okay enough for the unrelated introduction.  

## What's this app about?
It's a simple ToDo web application.  
You can enter a list of things "to do".  
You can edit/update an item after adding.  
You can also delete an item.  
It has a basic authentication feature "WWW-Authenticate" to block unauthorized access.  
This app is working for me 100%, and successfully deployed online via [Heroku](https://yaptodoapp.herokuapp.com/)  

## What does this app lack?
Since this was a really simple, I didn't find the importance in following the application development standard.  
With a tiny application like this I think I can still get away with it.  
Here are three things that this app is lacking:  
1.) Code Organization. There was no separation of the interface and logic codes.  
2.) Multi-user support. Right now, only me can login in to it.  
3.) Not enough details.  

## What's the stack used on this project?
MongoDB, Express, NodeJS.  
APIs: For asynchronus calls I used Axios. For for extra layer of security, I also used sanitize-html.
