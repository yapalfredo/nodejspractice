# nodejspractice - ToDoApp

## What's the purpose of this project?
Still part of my "getting back to coding in 2021" journey.
Trying to get used to JavaScript (NodeJS).
For the next week or two, I will just eat and sleep NodeJS.
After that, I will start learning Solidity so I can build smart contracts.
This is a stepping stone to achieving my goal.
I have an "unique idea", for a Decentralized Finance app in mind, and I haven't seen anyone implemented it yet.
I can't tell about it here yet because I want to be the first one to do it.
I'm basically on the research/acquiring skill phase right now. Once I'm done with this, I will go full throttle in building my app.
Okay enough for the unrelated introduction.

## What's this app about?
It's a simple ToDo web application.
You can enter a list of things "to do".
You can edit/update an item after adding.
You can also delete an item.
It has a basic authentication feature "WWW-Authenticate" to block unauthorized access.
This app is working for me 100%, and successfully deployed online via [Heroku](https://yaptodoapp.herokuapp.com/)

## What's the stack used on this project?
MongoDB, Express, NodeJS. 
APIs: For asynchronus calls I used Axios. For for extra layer of security, I also used sanitize-html.
